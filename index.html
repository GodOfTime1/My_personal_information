        <p>Hi my name is Nelson. Welcome to my website if you didn't see the big welcome sign above. 
        Up top there is a navigational bar with three different choices, learn about me, 
        my favorite games with some explanation about each game so you can try them out if you haven't yet 
        and the home page to return back to this page. I included a small cute photo of pokemons on the right 
        so you can adore those cuties. But, otherwise hop along and explore the website.</p>
