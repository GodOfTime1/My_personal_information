    <h2 class="champ">Skeleton King</h2>
    <img height='150px' src="cr/SkeletonKingCard.webp">
    <p class="data">Skeleton King is a repaer on the battlefield, claiming souls for his power up of Soul Summoning where he summons skeleton warriors(its not that strong). Pretty weak unit to be honest, not that much damage, low hp. But, if you need a distraction, he can be used in that purpose.</p>

    <h2 class="champ">Golden Knight</h2>
    <img height='150px' src="cr/golden_knight.webp">
    <p class="data">Golden Knight has a really good ability called Dashing Dash. He will dash through 10 enemies max(towers included) alongside. This ability is good for easily killing weak troops and possibly a hit on archer towers quick.</p>

    <h2 class="champ">Archer Queen</h2>
    <img height='150px' src="cr/archer_queen.webp">
    <p class="data">Archer Queen has a Cloaking Cape, when activated, no character can attack her, and her fire rate and damage is increased. One of the better champions in my opinion. Good damage and HP with range attacks.</p>

    <h2 class="champ">Mighty Miner</h2>
    <img height='150px' src="cr/mighty_miner.webp">
    <p class="data">One of the best units to easily destroy a tower, as the longer it attacks the faster the rate of his drill goes, which means more damage. His ability is Explosive Escape, a self-explanitory skill, where if you see a very strong enemy or too many enemies approaching, use his skill to go to the other lane, leaving a bomb in the place.</p>

    <h2 class="champ">Monk</h2>
    <img height='150px' src="cr/monk.webp"> 
    <p class="data">The deflection king, the holy, it's Monk. He has the ability called Pensive Protection. Monk essentially creates an aura around him, decrease damage taken by 80% and deflecting slow projectiles back to user which is a really good ability like deflecting a deadly rocket(can do 400 damage to your towers which is quite the amount).</p>
