          <th class="desc">Clash of Clans is one of the best strategy games you could play with you making some crazy builds and attacking or destroying other people's base. This is why Clash of Clans must be tryed out if not. 
            But, two slight cons you have to take into consideration. It's very time-consuming to upgrade your buildings(up to months for some things) and the chinese character username players with out of this world troops.</th>

          <th class="desc">Clash Royale is slowly decreasing in popularity for good players as the new updates are ruining balances in the game with over the top cards that can destroy everything with no effort. But, if you are a new player try it out
            it's another fun strategy game, planning out the best card deck to counter many other cards or strategies to prevail to the top. They have lots of challenges and tournaments you can challenge yourself with and also require precise placements to
            defend. Overall not too bad of a game, just has too many updates.

          <th class="name"><a href="brawl.html">Brawl Stars</a></th>
          <th class="desc">As you can see in the photo, Brawl Stars has quite the number of characters, for fastpaced gameplay that you want to play for 3-5 min in a break, this is it. With huge amount of skins and modes, you will always be engaged. As similar to other supercell games, 
            the longer you play, the longer it takes to get better, grinding trophies is the whole goal of pro players, with 5-10 trophies gained with each game and 3 min average per game, this game takes lots of willpower to continue driving forward to be considered good by other
            players. But you may be called a tryhard and sweat in the process but who cares. The gains talk back.
