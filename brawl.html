            <th class="name">Colt</th>
            <th>Colt is a rare brawler, who doesn't have lots of health but does have high dmaage. Everytime he uses his attack, he shoots <span id="colt_attack">6 bullets.</span>
            Colt's ultimate is the pretty much the same but with <span id="colt_ultimate">wall-breaking bullets and higher damage.</span> So, if you're a sharpshooter and have good aim, this character is for you!</th>

            <th class="name">Bo</th>
            <th>Bo is a epic brawler, he's another marksman who has pretty good damage and moderate health. His attack is a bow that shoots <span id="bo_attack">3 arrows.</span> His ultimate is a arrow shot into the air, and releasing <span id="bo_ultimate">3 mines into the ground</span>, activated when someone steps on it. 
                I don't like his attack due to inconsistant damage in a long-range battle. But his ult is pretty good damage wise and defense with the small knockback</th>

            <th class="name">Barley</th>
            <th>Next up we have Barley. Barley is a rare character. He's a splash so low health but good damage. His attack is hm throwing a bottle releasing a <span id="barley_attack">puddle of poison.</span> His ultimate is Barley throwing <span id="barley_ultimate">5 bottles of poison </span>creating a larger puddle of poison. I like him personally as I like playing more passively and Barley is perfect for that, with small assists in duos.</th>

            <th class="name">Shelly</th>
            <th>Shelly is a common, but don't let that decieve you she's one of the better damage-dealing units in the mid and early ranks. Her weapon is a <span id="shelly_attack">shotgun</span> and as such the closer she is to her target, the more damage is dealt. Her ultimate is similar to her attack, except her ultimate has <span id="shelly_ultimate">knockback and can destroy walls </span>like Colt.</th>

            <th>Rico is a super rare brawler. He has a simiar attack to Colt but <span id="rico_attack">his bullets bounces of walls</span>, so any trickshoters would love this character. Rico's does good damage, his ultimate shoots out <span id="rico_ultimate">more bouncy bullets.</span></th>

            <th><img height="300px" src="brawl/Carl.webp"/></th>
            <th class="name">Carl</th>
            <th>Carl is another Super Rare brawler who throws his <span id="carl_attack">pickaxe like a boomerang</span>. He has high hp but moderate damage. He reloads faster if his attack hits a wall without reaching full distance. His ultimate is a close range attack, with him <span id="carl_ultimate">spinning in a frenzy doing continuous damage</span>. Overall pretty good character, just not too good in close quarters unless he has ultimate ready.</th>
